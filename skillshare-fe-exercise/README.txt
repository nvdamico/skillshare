Welcome to the Skillshare FE Engineering Exercise.
[Approx. time required: < 2 hours]


---


Part I
=============

Within this .zip file, please find a .png that illustrates a list of comments.

As the Front-end lead on this project, you're tasked with implementing this comment module to exactly match the UI provided.

The only required functionality is as follows:

1. The json provided should be used to render the initial list of comments.
2. A user should be able to create new comments via the form, inserting each new comment at top of the list. (A 4th image asset has been provided to aid you with the creation of these new comments: 'user-img-4.png'.)
3. The post comment button should have a hover state (see specs.txt).

For this exercise, we've purposefully limited the feature's scope and functionality to keep implementation time low. Although the requirements for this feature are simple, please approach the build as if it were a part of a much larger, more complex application. We're most interested in how you structure and architect your application.

I.e. Think about how this comment module can be re-used, integrated into a larger project at scale, and be easily enhanced with future functionality.



Part II
=============

Lastly, we'd love to hear how you'd extend the functionality of this module.

Specifically, how would you evolve your solution to support:
  * nested replies to each of the comments (and nested replies to those replies)
  * deletion of a comment and its nested children
  * ability to "like" a comment
